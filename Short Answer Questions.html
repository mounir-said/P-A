    <h1>Short Answer Questions</h1>

    <h2>1. What is source code?</h2>
    <p>Source code is the human-readable set of instructions written by programmers in a programming language. It is the fundamental component that gets translated into machine code to be executed by a computer.</p>

    <h2>2. What makes computers so “smart”, anyway?</h2>
    <p>Computers are considered "smart" because they can process vast amounts of data quickly, execute complex algorithms, and perform tasks with precision based on the instructions (programs) they receive from humans.</p>

    <h2>3. What is the purpose of a programming language?</h2>
    <p>The purpose of a programming language is to provide a way for humans to communicate with computers, giving them instructions in a form that can be translated into machine code for execution.</p>

    <h2>4. What are 3 examples of programming languages? Why are there so many of these?</h2>
    <p>Examples: JavaScript, Python, Java. There are many programming languages because different languages are designed to solve different types of problems, provide various levels of abstraction, and support different styles of programming (e.g., object-oriented, functional).</p>

    <h2>5. What is a variable? Why are variables useful?</h2>
    <p>A variable is a container for storing data that can change over time. Variables are useful because they allow programmers to store, manipulate, and reuse data throughout a program.</p>

    <h2>6. What is the difference between a single-equals (=) and a double-equals (==)?</h2>
    <p>A single-equals (=) is used for assignment, meaning it assigns a value to a variable. A double-equals (==) is used for comparison, checking if two values are equal, with type conversion.</p>

    <h2>7. What is the difference between a double-equals (==) and a triple-equals (===)?</h2>
    <p>Double-equals (==) checks for equality after type conversion, while triple-equals (===) checks for both value and type equality without converting types.</p>

    <h2>8. Why does the developer console exist?</h2>
    <p>The developer console exists to help developers debug their code by providing real-time feedback, error messages, and the ability to interact with the browser's JavaScript environment.</p>

    <h2>9. When we talk about “conditional” statements, what does that mean? What is an example?</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on whether a condition is true or false. Example: <code>if (x > 10) { console.log('x is greater than 10'); }</code></p>

    <h2>10. Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code?</h2>
    <p>Loops allow us to repeat actions or iterate over data structures without manually writing the same code multiple times. They make code more efficient and easier to maintain.</p>

    <h2>11. When would you use a WHILE loop, instead of a FOR loop?</h2>
    <p>A WHILE loop is typically used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, while a FOR loop is used when the number of iterations is predetermined.</p>

    <h2>12. What is a function? Why would we use functions?</h2>
    <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions are used to organize code, make it reusable, and improve readability.</p>

    <h2>13. How many values can you receive back from a function? How many values can you send in?</h2>
    <p>A function can return a single value. However, you can send in multiple values as arguments to a function.</p>

    <h2>14. What is an array? How many values does it hold?</h2>
    <p>An array is a data structure that can hold multiple values in a single variable. The number of values an array can hold is determined by its length.</p>

    <h2>15. What is a T-diagram and why should I know how to use one?</h2>
    <p>A T-diagram is a visual tool used to represent the input and output of functions. It helps in understanding how data flows through a program and aids in debugging.</p>

    <h2>16. What are the two ways to comment JS code? When would you use one versus the other?</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to comment JavaScript code: single-line comments using <code>//</code> and multi-line comments using <code>/* comment */</code>. Use single-line comments for brief explanations and multi-line comments for longer descriptions or to temporarily disable blocks of code.</p>
