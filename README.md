JavaScript Functions Display
This project demonstrates several basic JavaScript functions that solve a series of fundamental coding tasks. The functions are displayed and executed within an HTML file. The user can interact with the page by clicking buttons to run the corresponding JavaScript functions and see the output.

How to Run the Project
1. Download/Clone the Project
Download or clone this project to your local machine.

2. Open the HTML File
Navigate to the project folder and open the index.html file in any web browser.

3. Interact with the Page
The HTML page contains buttons to trigger each JavaScript function. Here's how you can interact with the page:

Step 1: Open the index.html file in your browser.
Step 2: You will see a list of functions with corresponding buttons.
Step 3: Click the button to run a specific function. The result of the function will be displayed below the button in the output box.
Each button corresponds to one of the following functions:

Functionality
Setting and Swapping:
Click the button to swap the values of a number and a name and see the result.

Print -52 to 1066:
Prints all integers between -52 and 1066 using a for loop.

Don't Worry, Be Happy:
Prints the string "good morning!" 98 times.

Multiples of Three (Skip -3, -6):
Prints multiples of 3 between -300 and 0, but skips -3 and -6.

Print Integers 2000 to 5280:
Prints all integers from 2000 to 5280 using a while loop.

You Say It's Your Birthday:
Checks if the given numbers match your birthday (month and day) and logs a specific message.

Leap Year Check:
Checks if a given year is a leap year.

Print and Count Multiples of 5:
Prints multiples of 5 from 512 to 4096 and logs the count.

Multiples of Six:
Prints multiples of 6 up to 60,000 using a while loop.

Counting, the Dojo Way:
Prints integers from 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, prints "Coding". If divisible by 10, prints "Coding Dojo".

What Do You Know?:
Logs the input parameter to the console.

Whoa, That Sucker's Huge:
Calculates the sum of all odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000 and prints the result.

Countdown by Fours:
Logs positive numbers starting from 2016, counting down by fours (excluding 0).

Flexible Countdown:
Prints multiples of a given number from a high number down to a low number.

The Final Countdown:
Prints multiples of a given number, but skips one specific value. The function accepts 4 parameters to control the range and multiples.

4. Customize the Input
Some functions, like "You Say It's Your Birthday", "Leap Year Check", "Flexible Countdown", and "Final Countdown", can accept parameters. You can modify the JavaScript code directly to test with different inputs.
