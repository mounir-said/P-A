    <h1>JavaScript Short Answer Questions</h1>

    <h2>1. What is the JavaScript Math library? What does it contain?</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript Math library is a built-in object that provides mathematical constants and functions. It contains methods for basic arithmetic, trigonometric calculations, logarithms, exponentiation, and more.</p>

    <h2>2. Why aren’t all those functions just included in JavaScript automatically?</h2>
    <p>Not all mathematical functions are included in JavaScript automatically to keep the language lightweight and efficient. The Math library provides commonly used functions without cluttering the global namespace.</p>

    <h2>3. If I call Math.random(), what will it return?</h2>
    <p>Math.random() returns a pseudorandom floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).</p>

    <h2>4. What do the following functions do: Math.floor, Math.ceil, Math.trunc, Math.round?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Math.floor:</strong> Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.<br>
        <strong>Math.ceil:</strong> Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.<br>
        <strong>Math.trunc:</strong> Removes the fractional part of a number, returning the integer part.<br>
        <strong>Math.round:</strong> Rounds a number to the nearest integer, rounding up if the decimal is 0.5 or higher.
    </p>

    <h2>5. When do Math.floor and Math.trunc not return the same value?</h2>
    <p>Math.floor and Math.trunc do not return the same value for negative numbers. Math.floor rounds down to the nearest integer, while Math.trunc simply removes the decimal part.</p>

    <h2>6. What is the % operator? When is it useful?</h2>
    <p>The % operator is the modulus operator, which returns the remainder of a division operation. It is useful for determining if a number is even or odd, cycling through a range of values, or for constraints in algorithms.</p>

    <h2>7. How do I make variables declared outside (right next to) a function visible inside it?</h2>
    <p>You can make variables declared outside a function visible inside it by declaring them in a scope that encompasses both the function and the variable or by declaring them in the global scope.</p>

    <h2>8. Why should I comment my code? If I know what it does, isn’t commenting just a waste of time?</h2>
    <p>Commenting code is important for clarity and maintainability. It helps others (and your future self) understand the purpose of the code, the logic behind it, and any assumptions made. Comments can save time during debugging and future development.</p>
